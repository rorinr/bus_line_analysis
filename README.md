# bus_line_analysis
I scraped data of a bus line in my hometown, which includes bus stops, delay, time etc. After 3 months of scraping i analyze these data in regards to origins of delay, 
average delay on each bus stop and frequency of on-time-rides (everything with delay > 0 min. is not on time!). I used a rasperrry pi, python and selenium for Data Mining, 
pandas, matplotlib and numpy for Analysis.
Feel free to use all the data.
